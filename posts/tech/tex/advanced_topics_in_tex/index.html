<span class="line"><span style="color:#79B8FF">\end</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8">{equation}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This would produce a centered equation with the variables <code>y</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>x</code>, and <code>b</code>. You can also use commands such as <code>\frac</code> to create fractions, <code>\sqrt</code> to create square roots, and <code>\int</code> to create integrals.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><code>natbib</code>: To use <code>natbib</code>, you would include the following lines at the beginning of your document:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="astro-code github-dark" style="background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="latex"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#F97583">\usepackage</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8">{</span><span style="color:#79B8FF">natbib</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8">}</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#79B8FF">\bibliographystyle</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8">{plainnat}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This would load the <code>plainnat</code> citation style and tell LaTeX to use the <code>bibtex</code> tool to generate your bibliography. To cite a reference in your document, you would use the <code>\cite</code> command, followed by the citation key in curly braces. For example:</p>
<pre class="astro-code github-dark" style="background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="latex"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#E1E4E8">According to </span><span style="color:#F97583">\citep</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8">{</span><span style="color:#79B8FF">smith2010</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8">},...</span></span></code></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li><code>siunitx</code>: The <code>siunitx</code> package provides a variety of commands for typesetting units and quantities. For example, to write the temperature <code>25 °C</code> in LaTeX, you could use the following syntax:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="astro-code github-dark" style="background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="latex"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#79B8FF">\SI</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8">{25}{</span><span style="color:#79B8FF">\celsius</span><span style="color:#E1E4E8">}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This would produce <code>25 °C</code> with the correct degree symbol and spacing. You can also use commands such as <code>\SIrange</code> to create ranges of values, and <code>\num</code> to format numbers.</p>
<p>Here are some best practices for academic document preparation using LaTeX:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a template: Many universities and academic institutions provide LaTeX templates for dissertations, theses, and other academic documents. These templates can save you time and help ensure that your document meets the formatting requirements of your institution.</li>
<li>Organize your files: Keep your LaTeX files organized and well-structured. Use a folder for each project and keep related files, such as images and bibliography files, in subfolders.</li>
<li>Use version control: Use a version control system like Git to keep track of changes to your document and collaborate with others. This can help prevent data loss and make it easier to revert to previous versions of your document if needed.</li>
<li>Use consistent formatting: Use consistent formatting throughout your document, such as font sizes, margins, and line spacing. Use a consistent citation style and ensure that your bibliography is properly formatted.</li>
<li>Use packages wisely: Use LaTeX packages to enhance your document, but use them judiciously. Using too many packages can make your document more complex and harder to maintain.</li>
<li>Use comments: Use comments to document your LaTeX code and explain what each section of code does. This can help you and others understand your document and make it easier to modify and update.</li>
<li>Proofread and edit: As with any document, proofread and edit your LaTeX document carefully before submitting it. Use tools like spell checkers and grammar checkers to help catch errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these best practices, you can create high-quality academic documents with LaTeX that are well-organized, easy to read, and conform to the standards of your institution.</p>
