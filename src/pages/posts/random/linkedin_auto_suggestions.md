LinkedIn is a social media platform designed for professional networking. It is a way for individuals to connect with other professionals in their industry, as well as companies and job opportunities. LinkedIn allows users to create profiles that highlight their professional experiences and skills, and to connect with others in their professional network. The platform also offers tools for job seekers, such as the ability to search for job listings and apply for jobs online.


AI, or artificial intelligence, is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. In the context of messaging, AI technology can be used to provide suggestions for responses to messages. This can help users save time and improve their messaging experience by providing them with quick and relevant responses to messages. However, the specific features and functionality of AI-powered messaging suggestions may vary depending on the specific platform or application.

For the purpose of this story, I shall not name the stranger. I will call them stranger and have concealed my name.


One potential pitfall of messaging suggestions is the possibility of generating circular suggestions, where the suggestions provided by the AI system simply repeat the input from the user without adding any new information or ideas. This can be frustrating for users and can make the messaging experience feel unproductive or unhelpful. Additionally, if the AI system is not able to generate a wide range of suggestions, it may not be able to provide users with the variety of responses they need to have a productive conversation. These limitations can make messaging suggestions less effective and less useful for users.
