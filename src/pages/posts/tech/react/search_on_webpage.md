# Algolia Search

Algolia is a powerful and scalable search-as-a-service solution that allows you to add lightning-fast search functionality to your website or application. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API that can be integrated into your website or application using a variety of SDKs, including JavaScript, PHP, and Python.

To add Algolia search to your website, you first need to sign up for an Algolia account and create an index for your website's data. Once you have created an index, you can then use one of Algolia's SDKs to integrate search functionality into your website or application.

Here's an example of how to add Algolia search to your website using the JavaScript SDK:

Install the Algolia JavaScript SDK:

```
npm install algoliasearch
```

Initialize the Algolia client with your application ID and API key:

```js
const algoliasearch = require('algoliasearch');

const client = algoliasearch('APPLICATION_ID', 'API_KEY');
```

Index your data:

```js
const index = client.initIndex('INDEX_NAME');

const data = [
  { objectID: '1', title: 'Product 1', description: 'This is the first product' },
  { objectID: '2', title: 'Product 2', description: 'This is the second product' },
  { objectID: '3', title: 'Product 3', description: 'This is the third product' },
];

index.addObjects(data, (err, content) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(content);
  }
});
```

4. Implement search functionality in your website:

```js
const searchInput = document.querySelector('#search-input');

searchInput.addEventListener('input', () => {
  index.search(searchInput.value, (err, content) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
    } else {
      console.log(content.hits);
    }
  });
});
```

This code initializes the Algolia client, indexes some data, and implements a search input that listens for user input and performs a search on the Algolia index. The search results are then logged to the console.

Algolia search provides many powerful features, such as faceting, typo-tolerance, and relevance ranking, that can help you deliver a better search experience to your website's users.

# Custom search with React and Fuse.js

Adding a search functionality to your website can greatly improve its usability. However, implementing search can be a challenging task. In this post, we'll go through the steps to add a custom search feature to your website using React and Fuse.js.

Fuse.js is a lightweight fuzzy-search library that can easily be integrated with React. It allows you to search through a collection of items with support for various options like searching for partial matches, exact matches, and more. With Fuse.js, you can also configure the search algorithm and its options to improve search results.

### Installation

First, you'll need to install Fuse.js as a dependency in your project. You can do this using npm:


```jsx
npm install fuse.js
```
### Usage

Once you have installed Fuse.js, you can use it in your React components. Here's an example of how to implement a search component using Fuse.js:


```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Fuse from 'fuse.js';

const Search = ({ data }) => {
 const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
 const options = {
 keys: ['title', 'author.name'],
 };
 const fuse = new Fuse(data, options);

 const results = fuse.search(query);

 return (
 <div>
 <input
 type="text"
 value={query}
 onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
 />
 <ul>
 {results.map((item) => (
 <li key={item.id}>
 {item.title} by {item.author.name}
 </li>
 ))}
 </ul>
 </div>
 );
};

export default Search;
```
Here, we've defined a `Search` component that accepts an array of `data` as a prop. In our case, `data` is an array of objects that represent books. We use the `useState` hook to keep track of the search query.

We then create a new instance of `Fuse` using the `data` array and an options object. In this case, we're searching for matches in the `title` and `author.name` keys.

Finally, we render an input element and a list of results. The list is created by mapping over the `results` array returned by `fuse.search()`.

That's it! With just a few lines of code, you can add a custom search feature to your React app using Fuse.js. The library is highly configurable, allowing you to fine-tune search results to match your specific needs.


Using Google Search on Your Site

Adding a search bar to your website can improve its usability by allowing users to quickly find what they're looking for. One popular solution is to use Google Search, which provides accurate and relevant results based on the user's query.

In this post, we'll go through the steps to add Google Search to your website.

### 1. Create a Custom Search Engine

First, you'll need to create a Custom Search Engine (CSE) in your Google account. Go to the [Google Custom Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/) page and click on the "Get Started" button.

Follow the steps to create your CSE, including entering the website you want to search and any additional search features you want to enable. Once you've created your CSE, you'll be given a unique search engine ID that you can use to integrate Google Search on your site.

### 2. Add the Search Bar

Next, you'll need to add the Google Search bar to your website. You can do this by copying the code snippet provided by Google and pasting it into your HTML code.

Here's an example of what the HTML code for the search bar might look like:


```jsx
html`<form action="https://www.google.com/search" method="get">
 <input type="hidden" name="cx" value="YOUR\_SEARCH\_ENGINE\_ID">
 <input type="hidden" name="ie" value="UTF-8">
 <input type="text" name="q" size="40" placeholder="Search...">
 <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Search">
</form>
```
Make sure to replace `YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID` with your actual search engine ID.

### 3. Style the Search Bar

Finally, you can style the search bar to match your website's design. Here's an example of how you might style the search bar using CSS:


```css
form {
 display: flex;
 justify-content: center;
 align-items: center;
}

input[type="text"] {
 font-size: 1rem;
 padding: 0.5rem;
 border: none;
 border-bottom: 2px solid #ccc;
 margin-right: 0.5rem;
 flex: 1;
}

input[type="submit"] {
 background-color: #333;
 color: #fff;
 padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
 border: none;
 cursor: pointer;
}
```
This CSS code will center the search bar on the page and style the input and submit buttons.

That's it! By following these simple steps, you can add Google Search to your website and provide a powerful search feature for your users. With Google's advanced search algorithms and indexing capabilities, your users will be able to find the content they're looking for quickly and easily.


## Adding Search Using PHP

Adding a search feature to your website can help your users find the content they're looking for quickly and easily. In this post, we'll go through the steps to add a search bar to your website using PHP.

### 1. Create the Search Form

The first step is to create a search form in HTML. Here's an example of what the HTML code might look like:


```html
<form action="search.php" method="get">
 <input type="text" name="query" placeholder="Search...">
 <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Search">
</form>
```
This code creates a form with an input field for the search query and a submit button. The form action is set to "search.php", which is the name of the PHP script that will handle the search.

### 2. Create the PHP Script

Next, you'll need to create the PHP script that will handle the search. Here's an example of what the PHP code might look like:


```php
<?php
// Check if the search form has been submitted
if (isset($\_GET['submit'])) {
 // Get the search query
 $query = $\_GET['query'];
 
 // Perform the search
 $results = perform\_search($query);
 
 // Display the search results
 foreach ($results as $result) {
 echo "<div class='result'>";
 echo "<h3>{$result['title']}</h3>";
 echo "<p>{$result['description']}</p>";
 echo "<a href='{$result['url']}'>Read More</a>";
 echo "</div>";
 }
}

// Function to perform the search
function perform\_search($query) {
 // Connect to the database
 $conn = mysqli\_connect("localhost", "username", "password", "database");
 
 // Escape the search query
 $query = mysqli\_real\_escape\_string($conn, $query);
 
 // Perform the search query
 $sql = "SELECT \* FROM articles WHERE title LIKE '%$query%' OR content LIKE '%$query%'";
 $result = mysqli\_query($conn, $sql);
 
 // Fetch the search results
 $results = array();
 while ($row = mysqli\_fetch\_assoc($result)) {
 $results[] = $row;
 }
 
 // Close the database connection
 mysqli\_close($conn);
 
 // Return the search results
 return $results;
}
?>
```
This code checks if the search form has been submitted and gets the search query. It then calls the `perform_search` function, which connects to the database and performs a search query based on the search query. The search results are then displayed using a `foreach` loop.

### 3. Style the Search Results

Finally, you can style the search results to match your website's design. Here's an example of how you might style the search results using CSS:


```css
.result {
 margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.result h3 {
 margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

.result p {
 margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}

.result a {
 color: #333;
 text-decoration: none;
 border-bottom: 1px dotted #333;
}
```
This CSS code will style the search results with a title, description, and link.

By following these simple steps, you can add a search feature to your website using PHP. With PHP's ability to connect to databases and perform search queries, you can create a powerful search feature that will improve the usability of your website.

## Adding Search Using PageFind

```jsx
const pagefind = new PageFind({
 searchInput: document.querySelector('#search-input'),
 resultsContainer: document.querySelector('#search-results'),
 indexUrl: 'path/to/search.json',
});
```
This code initializes PageFind with a search input field, a container for the search results, and the path to the search index.

### 5. Customize PageFind

PageFind comes with a set of default options that can be customized to fit your website's design and functionality. Here's an example of how to customize PageFind:


```jsx
const pagefind = new PageFind({
