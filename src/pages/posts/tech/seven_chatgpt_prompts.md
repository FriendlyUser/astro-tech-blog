Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to improve the performance of language models like ChatGPT. It involves carefully crafting text prompts to elicit the desired response from the model.

Prompt engineering is useful because it allows us to fine-tune language models to specific tasks, making them more effective at generating high-quality responses. By designing prompts that encourage the model to focus on the relevant information and avoid irrelevant details, we can improve the accuracy and relevance of the model's output. This is particularly important in applications where the model's output is critical, such as in medical diagnosis or financial analysis.
