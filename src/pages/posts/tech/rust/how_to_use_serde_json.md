serde_json is a Rust library that can be used to serialize and deserialize JSON data. It is a popular library that is used by many Rust projects.

Serialization
Serialization is the process of converting data into a format that can be stored or transmitted. Serde_json can be used to serialize Rust data structures into JSON format.

Deserialization
Deserialization is the process of converting data from a stored or transmitted format into a Rust data structure. Serde_json can be used to deserialize JSON data into Rust data structures.
Installation
To install serde_json, we can use the following command:

```
cargo install serde_json
```

Usage
To use serde_json, we need to import the serde_json crate. We can do this using the following code:

```rust
use serde_json;
```

Once we have imported the serde_json crate, we can use it to serialize and deserialize JSON data.

Serialization
To serialize a Rust data structure into JSON format, we can use the to_string method. The to_string method takes a Rust data structure as its argument and returns a JSON string.
For example, the following code serializes a Person struct into JSON format:

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}

fn main() {
    let person = Person {
        name: "John Doe",
        age: 30,
    };

    let json_string = serde_json::to_string(&person).unwrap();

    println!("{}", json_string);
}
```

This code will print the following JSON string:

```rust
{"name":"John Doe","age":30}
```

Deserialization
To deserialize a JSON string into a Rust data structure, we can use the from_str method. The from_str method takes a JSON string as its argument and returns a Rust data structure.
For example, the following code deserializes a JSON string into a Person struct:
```rust
fn main() {
    let json_string = "{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"age\":30}";

    let person: Person = serde_json::from_str(&json_string).unwrap();

    println!("{}", person.name);
    println!("{}", person.age);
}
```
This code will print the following output:
```
John Doe
30
```

Conclusion

In this article, we learned how to use serde_json to serialize and deserialize JSON data. We started by installing serde_json. We then learned how to serialize a Rust data structure into JSON format. Finally, we learned how to deserialize a JSON string into a Rust data structure.
