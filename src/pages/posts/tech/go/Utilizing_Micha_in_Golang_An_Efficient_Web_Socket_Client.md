# Utilizing Micha in Golang: An Efficient Web Socket Client

In the modern era of web development, real-time communication between client-side and server-side applications has become essential. WebSockets enable bidirectional communication without the need for a constant request-response pattern. In Golang, there are numerous libraries available to help developers create WebSocket-based applications. One such library is **Micha**.

Micha is an efficient and easy-to-use WebSocket client library for Golang that allows developers to build real-time applications with ease. In this article, we will explore the steps to implement Micha in Golang, providing examples and best practices.

## Installation

First, you need to install the Micha library. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get -u github.com/sacOO7/micha
```

After the installation is complete, you can include it in your Golang project by importing the library:

```go
import "github.com/sacOO7/micha"
```

## Creating a WebSocket Client

To create a WebSocket client and connect to a WebSocket server, you must first create an instance of the `micha.WebSocket` struct, passing the WebSocket server URL as a parameter. After creating the instance, you can define the various event handlers and connect to the server.

Here's an example of how to create a WebSocket client and connect to a server:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/sacOO7/micha"
)

func main() {
	// Define WebSocket server URL
	url := "ws://example.com/websocket"

	// Create a new WebSocket instance
	client := micha.NewWebSocket(url)

	// Define event handlers
	client.OnConnected = func(ws *micha.WebSocket) {
		fmt.Println("Connected to server")
	}

	client.OnConnectError = func(err error) {
		fmt.Printf("Connection error: %s\n", err)
	}

	client.OnTextMessage = func(message string) {
		fmt.Printf("Received text message: %s\n", message)
	}

	client.OnBinaryMessage = func(data []byte) {
		fmt.Printf("Received binary message: %v\n", data)
	}

	client.OnDisconnected = func() {
		fmt.Println("Disconnected from server")
	}

	// Connect to WebSocket server
	client.Connect()

	// Wait for user input to close the program
	fmt.Scanln()
}
```

## Sending Messages

To send messages to the WebSocket server, use the `SendText()` and `SendBinary()` methods of the `micha.WebSocket` struct. These methods allow you to send text and binary data, respectively.

Here's an example of how to send a text message:

```go
client.SendText("Hello, WebSocket!")
```

And here's an example of how to send binary data:

```go
data := []byte{0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05}
client.SendBinary(data)
```

## Disconnecting from the Server

To disconnect from the WebSocket server, call the `Disconnect()` method:

```go
client.Disconnect()
```

## Conclusion

Micha is an efficient and easy-to-use WebSocket client library for Golang that helps developers build real-time applications with ease. By following the examples and best practices shared in this article, you can quickly create WebSocket clients and interact with WebSocket servers in your Golang projects.

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to use Micha in Golang, you can start exploring its advanced features, such as customizing connection headers, handling connection timeouts, and more.
