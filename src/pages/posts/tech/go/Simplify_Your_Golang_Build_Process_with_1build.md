# Simplify Your Golang Build Process with 1build

Building software projects often requires the execution of multiple commands in the correct order. For Golang developers, this might include running tests, formatting code, building binaries, and deploying the application. In this article, we'll explore how to simplify the Go build process using 1build, a command-line tool that enables the creation of a unified configuration file to manage all your build commands.

## Introduction to 1build

1build is an open-source command-line tool designed to help developers manage and maintain build automation processes with a single configuration file. The aim is to simplify the build process, eliminate the need to remember multiple commands, and encourage a consistent build process across the team.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need:

1. Go installed on your local machine (version 1.16 or higher).
2. Familiarity with basic Golang concepts and project structure.

## Installing 1build

To install 1build, open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
curl -sfL https://get.1build.app | sh
```

This command downloads and installs 1build on your system. Once the installation is complete, verify that it works by running:

```sh
1build --version
```

You should see the installed version number displayed in the output.

## Setting Up a Golang Project

Before we dive into using 1build, let's set up a simple Golang project. Create a new directory for your project and initialize it as a Go module:

```sh
mkdir my-golang-project
cd my-golang-project
go mod init github.com/your-username/my-golang-project
```

Next, create a basic `main. file:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, 1build!")
}
```

Now, we're ready to configure our build process with 1build.

## Creating a 1build Configuration File

1build uses a YAML file called `1build.yaml` to store the build configuration. In the root directory of your project, create a new file named `1build.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml
commands:
  - name: build
    command: go build -o my-app
  - name: test
    command: go test ./...
  - name: fmt
    command: go fmt ./...
  - name: run
    command: ./my-app
```

This configuration defines four build commands:

1. `build`: Compiles the Go code and generates the binary `my-app`.
2. `test`: Runs the tests in the project.
3. `fmt`: Formats the Go code according to the standard Go conventions.
4. `run`: Executes the compiled binary.

## Using 1build Commands

With the `1build.yaml` file in place, you can now execute the defined commands using the 1build CLI. For example, to build your project, run:

```sh
1build build
```

This command compiles your Go code and creates the binary `my-app`. Similarly, you can run the other commands like this:

```sh
1build test
1build fmt
1build run
```

Each command executes the corresponding action defined in the `1build.yaml` file.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how to use 1build to simplify the build process for Golang projects. By creating a single configuration file, you can manage and maintain your build commands more efficiently, eliminate the need to remember multiple commands, and ensure a consistent build process across your team.
