# GoAudio: A Powerful Audio Processing Library for Golang

Audio processing has become an integral part of modern applications, with use cases ranging from entertainment and gaming to scientific research and analysis. In this article, we will explore GoAudio, a powerful and versatile audio processing library for Golang.

## Introduction to GoAudio

GoAudio is an open-source audio processing library built on top of the Go programming language. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for processing, analyzing, and manipulating audio data. GoAudio is designed with performance and concurrency in mind, leveraging Golang's powerful features to deliver efficient and scalable audio processing solutions.

### Key Features of GoAudio

- Support for various audio file formats, including WAV, MP3, and FLAC
- Audio decoding and encoding
- Sample rate conversion
- Audio filtering and equalization
- Frequency and time-domain analysis
- Support for multi-channel audio
- Intuitive and easy-to-use API
- Concurrency support for parallel processing

## Getting Started with GoAudio

To get started with GoAudio, you need to have Golang installed on your system. After setting up your Go environment, install the GoAudio library using the following command:

```bash
go get -u github.com/goaudio/goaudio
```

Let's take a look at some common audio processing tasks using GoAudio.

### Loading and Saving Audio Files

GoAudio makes it easy to load and save audio files in different formats. The following example demonstrates how to load a WAV file, manipulate its audio data, and save the result as an MP3 file:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/goaudio/goaudio"
	"github.com/goaudio/wav"
	"github.com/goaudio/mp3"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Load a WAV file
	inFile, err := os.Open("input.wav")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer inFile.Close()

	decoder := wav.NewDecoder(inFile)
	buffer, err := decoder.FullPCMBuffer()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Process audio data (e.g., amplify the audio)
	for i := 0; i < buffer.Len(); i++ {
		buffer.Data[i] *= 2
	}

	// Save the result as an MP3 file
	outFile, err := os.Create("output.mp3")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer outFile.Close()

	encoder := mp3.NewEncoder(outFile, buffer.Format.SampleRate, 128)
	err = encoder.Encode(buffer)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

### Filtering and Equalization

GoAudio provides various audio filters, such as low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters. Here's an example of how to apply a low-pass filter to an audio file:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/goaudio/goaudio"
	"github.com/goaudio/audiobuffer"
	"github.com/goaudio/biquad"
)

func main() {
	// Load audio data (assuming `buffer` is an *audiobuffer.AudioBuffer)
	// ...

	// Apply a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz
	filter := biquad.NewLowPass(500, buffer.Format.SampleRate)
	filter.Process(buffer)

	// Save the filtered audio data
	// ...
}
```

### Frequency and Time-Domain Analysis

GoAudio offers tools for analyzing audio data in both frequency and time domains. The following example demonstrates how to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on audio data:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/goaudio/goaudio"
	"github.com/goaudio/audiobuffer"
	"github.com/goaudio/spectral"
)

func main() {
	// Load audio data (assuming `buffer` is an *audiobuffer.AudioBuffer)
	// ...

	// Perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on audio data
	fft := spectral.NewFFT(buffer.Format.NumChannels, buffer.Format.SampleRate)
	fftResult := fft.Process(buffer)

	// Analyze the FFT result (e.g., finding the peak frequency)
	// ...
}
```

## Conclusion

GoAudio is a powerful and versatile audio processing library for Golang. Its rich feature set and easy-to-use API make it an excellent choice for developers looking to add audio processing capabilities to their applications. With GoAudio, you can load and save audio files, apply filters and equalization, and perform frequency and time-domain analysis with ease.
