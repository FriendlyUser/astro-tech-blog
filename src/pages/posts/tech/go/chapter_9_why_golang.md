Web development is an essential skill for any modern-day programmer, and Go provides a robust framework for creating web applications. In this chapter, we'll cover the basics of web development in Go, including how to build a simple web server, handle HTTP requests, and create dynamic web pages using templates.

### Building a Simple Web Server

The first step in web development with Go is to create a web server. Here's a simple example:


```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "net/http"
)

func main() {
 http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
 http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r \*http.Request) {
 fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s!", r.URL.Path[1:])
}
```
This code creates a simple web server that listens on port 8080 and responds to all requests with the message "Hello, [name]!" where `[name]` is whatever follows the forward slash in the URL.

### Handling HTTP Requests

To handle HTTP requests in Go, you need to define a handler function that takes an `http.ResponseWriter` and an `http.Request` as arguments. The `http.ResponseWriter` is used to send the response back to the client, while the `http.Request` contains information about the incoming request, such as the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and any parameters or headers.

Here's an example handler function that handles GET requests for a specific URL:


```go
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r \*http.Request) {
 if r.Method == "GET" && r.URL.Path == "/hello" {
 fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
 } else {
 w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)
 }
}
```
This code checks if the incoming request is a GET request for the `/hello` URL. If it is, it sends the message "Hello, World!" back to the client. If it's not, it sends a 404 Not Found status code.

### Creating Dynamic Web Pages with Templates

Finally, you can use Go's built-in template engine to create dynamic web pages. Here's an example:


```go
package main

import (
 "html/template"
 "net/http"
)

type Person struct {
 Name string
 Age int
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r \*http.Request) {
 p := Person{"Alice", 30}
 t, _ := template.ParseFiles("template.html")
 t.Execute(w, p)
}

func main() {
 http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
 http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
This code defines a `Person` struct and a handler function that creates a `Person` object and passes it to a template file called `template.html`. The `template.ParseFiles` function reads in the template file and returns a `*template.Template` object, which can be executed with the `t.Execute` method to generate the final HTML output.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we covered the basics of web development in Go, including how to build a simple web server, handle HTTP requests, and create dynamic web pages using templates. Go provides a simple and powerful framework for web development, making it a great choice for building web applications of all kinds.


In web development with Go, the HTTP package is the foundation for handling HTTP requests and responses. It provides the `http.ListenAndServe` function for starting an HTTP server, as well as a number of other functions and types for working with HTTP requests and responses.

Here's an example of using the HTTP package to handle an HTTP request:


```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r \*http.Request) {
 fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s!", r.URL.Path[1:])
}

func main() {
 http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
 http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
In this example, the `http.HandleFunc` function is used to register the `handler` function to handle incoming HTTP requests to the root path. The `http.ListenAndServe` function is then used to start the HTTP server, listening on port 8080.

### Conclusion

The HTTP package in Go provides a simple and powerful way to handle HTTP requests and responses in web development. With the `http.ListenAndServe` function and the `http.HandleFunc` function, you can quickly build a web server that responds to incoming HTTP requests.


In web development with Go, a web application is a program that runs on a web server and provides a web interface for users to interact with. Web applications are typically built using the HTTP package, which provides the foundation for handling HTTP requests and responses.

Here's an example of a simple web application in Go:


```go
package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r \*http.Request) {
 fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s!", r.URL.Path[1:])
}

func main() {
 http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
 http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
In this example, the `handler` function is used to handle incoming HTTP requests to the root path. The `http.HandleFunc` function is then used to register the `handler` function with the HTTP server. Finally, the `http.ListenAndServe` function is used to start the HTTP server, listening on port 8080.

### Conclusion

Web applications are a fundamental part of web development, and Go provides a simple and powerful way to build them. With the HTTP package, you can quickly build a web server that responds to incoming HTTP requests, allowing you to create dynamic web applications that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
