# Using Viper in Golang for Configuration Management

In this article, we will explore the use of Viper, a powerful library in the Go programming language (Golang) ecosystem for managing configuration files. Viper supports multiple configuration formats, including JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, envfile, and Java properties config files. It also provides features like live watching and re-reading of config files, environment variable support, and more.

## Introduction to Viper

Viper is a Go library that provides a simple solution for managing and accessing configuration data in your applications. It was created by [Steve Francia](https://github.com/spf13) and is widely used in the Go community. Some of the key features of Viper include:

* Support for multiple configuration formats (JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, envfile, and Java properties config files)
* Automatic environment variable binding
* Live watching and re-reading of config files
* Setting default values for configuration keys

## Installation and Setup

To get started, you'll need to have Go installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Go yet, you can follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Once you have Go installed, you can install the Viper library using the `go get` command:

```sh
go get github.com/spf13/viper
```

Now, you can import Viper into your Go project:

```go
import "github.com/spf13/viper"
```

## Creating a Configuration File

For this example, we will create a YAML configuration file named `config.yaml`:

```yaml
