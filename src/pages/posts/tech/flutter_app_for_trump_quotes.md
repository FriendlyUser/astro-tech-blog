Recently i was updating my flutter quotes trump app to use the latest version of flutter, here are some of the lessons i learned.

Its simplest to copy the code from the previous version of the app and then update the code to use the latest version of flutter. This way you can see the changes that were made to the code.

Making a new flutter project and adjusting code is my preference.


The following code retrieves a quote from the api and displays it on the screen.
```dart
Future<Quote> fetchQuote() async {
  final response =
      await http.get('https://api.tronalddump.io/random/quote', headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
    'Accept': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
  });

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // If the server did return a 200 OK response,
    // then parse the JSON.
    return Quote.fromJson(json.decode(response.body));
  } else {
    // If the server did not return a 200 OK response,
    // then throw an exception.
    throw Exception('Failed to load quote');
  }
}

class Quote {
  final String appearedAt;
  final String createdAt;
  final String quoteId;
  final String updatedAt;
  final List<dynamic> tags;
  final String value;

  Quote(
      {this.appearedAt,
      this.createdAt,
      this.quoteId,
      this.updatedAt,
      this.tags,
      this.value});

  factory Quote.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return Quote(
        appearedAt: json['appeared_at'],
        createdAt: json['created_at'],
        quoteId: json['quoteId'],
        updatedAt: json['updated_at'],
        tags: json['tags'],
        value: json['value']);
  }
}
```



My yaml file is used to automatically download the latest version of flutter and dart. This is useful because it means that i don't have to manually update the version of flutter and dart that i am using.

As well as upload to google play developer console.
