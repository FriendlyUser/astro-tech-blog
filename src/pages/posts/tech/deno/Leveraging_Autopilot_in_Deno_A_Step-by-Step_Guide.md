# Leveraging Autopilot in Deno: A Step-by-Step Guide

In recent years, Deno has emerged as a popular runtime for executing JavaScript and TypeScript outside of the web browser. Its secure-by-default, modular design, and built-in features make it an attractive choice for developers. One of the lesser-known capabilities of Deno is its support for autopilot, a feature that enables developers to automate browser tasks.

In this article, we will explore how to use autopilot in Deno, focusing on setting up the environment, writing a basic script, and executing browser automation tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into autopilot, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

1. Deno: [Install Deno](https://deno.land/#installation) by following the instructions for your operating system.

2. A modern web browser: Autopilot works with popular web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

## Setting Up the Environment

To use autopilot in Deno, you will first need to install the autopilot module. Create a `deps.ts` file and import the module as follows:

```typescript
// deps.ts
export { autopilot } from "https://deno.land/x/autopilot/mod.ts";
```

This will allow you to use autopilot in your Deno scripts by simply importing it from `deps.ts`.

## Writing a Basic Autopilot Script

Now that you have the environment set up, let's write a basic autopilot script. Create a new file called `autopilot_example.ts` and import the autopilot module:

```typescript
// autopilot_example.ts
import { autopilot } from "./deps.ts";
```

Next, create a new instance of the `Autopilot` class:

```typescript
const pilot = new autopilot.Autopilot();
```

Now, you can use the methods available in the `Autopilot` class to interact with the browser. Let's write a script that navigates to a URL, takes a screenshot, and saves it to a local file:

```typescript
async function runAutopilot() {
  // Navigate to the desired URL
  await pilot.goto("https://deno.land");

  // Take a screenshot
  const screenshot = await pilot.screenshot();

  // Save the screenshot to a local file
  await Deno.writeFile("deno_land_screenshot.png", screenshot);
}

runAutopilot();
```

This script will open the default web browser, navigate to the Deno website, take a screenshot, and save it as `deno_land_screenshot.png` in the current working directory.

## Running the Autopilot Script

To run the autopilot script, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-write autopilot_example.ts
```

The `--allow-net` flag is needed to grant network access, while the `--allow-write` flag allows the script to write the screenshot to the local file system.

After running the script, you should see a new file named `deno_land_screenshot.png` containing a screenshot of the Deno website.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've shown how to set up and use autopilot with Deno for browser automation tasks. The autopilot module provides a simple and powerful way to interact with web browsers, making it an excellent tool for web scraping, testing, and automating repetitive tasks.

With a comprehensive API and a growing ecosystem of Deno modules, the possibilities for leveraging autopilot are endless. To learn more about autopilot and its capabilities, refer to the [official documentation](https://deno.land/x/autopilot/README.md).
