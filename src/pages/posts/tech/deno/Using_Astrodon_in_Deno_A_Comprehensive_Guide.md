# Using Astrodon in Deno: A Comprehensive Guide

Astrodon is a powerful library for building web applications in Deno, a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. Deno is designed to provide a modern, secure, and productive environment for web developers. In this article, we'll explore how you can use Astrodon to simplify and improve your Deno development experience.

Astrodon is named after the colorful, iridescent mineral that resembles a mini universe. Just like its namesake, Astrodon is a visually appealing and highly functional library for Deno.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Astrodon, ensure that you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Deno](https://deno.land/): A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A popular source code editor with Deno support.
- [Deno extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno): Provides Deno support in Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started

To begin, create a new Deno project and initialize a `deps.ts` file to manage your dependencies.

```sh
$ mkdir deno-astrodon
$ cd deno-astrodon
$ echo "export {};" > deps.ts
```

Next, add Astrodon as a dependency in your `deps.ts` file.

```ts
// deps.ts
export { Astrodon } from "https://deno.land/x/astrodon/mod.ts";
```

Now, create a new file named `main.ts` to start building your Astrodon-powered Deno application.

```ts
// main.ts
import { Astrodon } from "./deps.ts";

const app = new Astrodon();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, Astrodon!");
});

await app.listen({ port: 3000 });
```

In this example, we create an instance of the Astrodon web application and define a simple route to handle incoming GET requests to the root path ("/"). The route simply responds with the text "Hello, Astrodon!".

Start the Deno server by running the following command:

```sh
$ deno run --allow-net main.ts
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the "Hello, Astrodon!" message displayed.

## Building a REST API with Astrodon

To showcase Astrodon's capabilities, let's build a simple REST API for managing a list of tasks. We'll implement the following endpoints:

- `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
- `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
- `PUT /tasks/:id`: Update an existing task.
- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Delete a task.

First, let's create a `Task` interface and a simple in-memory storage for tasks.

```ts
// task.ts
export interface Task {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

// tasks.ts
import { Task } from "./task.ts";

export const tasks: Task[] = [];
```

Next, import the `tasks` array and the `Task` interface into the `main.ts` file.

```ts
// main.ts
import { Astrodon } from "./deps.ts";
import { tasks, Task } from "./tasks.ts";

// ...
```

Now, let's implement the REST API endpoints.

### Retrieve All Tasks

```ts
app.get("/tasks", (req, res) => {
  res.json(tasks);
});
```

### Create a New Task

```ts
app.post("/tasks", async (req, res) => {
  const newTask: Task = await req.body();
  newTask.id = tasks.length + 1;
  newTask.completed = false;
  tasks.push(newTask);
  res.status(201).json(newTask);
});
```

### Update an Existing Task

```ts
app.put("/tasks/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const id = Number(req.params.id);
  const update: Partial<Task> = await req.body();
  const task = tasks.find((t) => t.id === id);

  if (task) {
    Object.assign(task, update);
    res.json(task);
  } else {
    res.status(404).send("Task not found");
  }
});
```

### Delete a Task

```ts
app.delete("/tasks/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = Number(req.params.id);
  const index = tasks.findIndex((t) => t.id === id);

  if (index >= 0) {
    tasks.splice(index, 1);
    res.send("Task deleted");
  } else {
    res.status(404).send("Task not found");
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we've introduced Astrodon, a powerful library for building web applications in Deno.We've demonstrated how to set up a Deno project with Astrodon, and how to build a simple REST API for managing tasks. Astrodon makes it easy to create and manage routes, handle request data, and send responses with minimal boilerplate.

By leveraging the security and simplicity of Deno, along with the elegance of Astrodon, you can build robust, maintainable web applications with ease. Give Astrodon a try in your next Deno project and experience the benefits it has to offer.
