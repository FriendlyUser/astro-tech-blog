# Building Cross-Platform Desktop Applications with WebAssembly

As the demand for cross-platform desktop applications grows, developers are continuously exploring innovative methods to create efficient and maintainable solutions. With the advent of WebAssembly, a new era of building cross-platform applications has begun. In this article, we'll explore the potential of WebAssembly for building desktop applications and discuss how to get started with it.

## What is WebAssembly?

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

The primary goal of WebAssembly is to provide a compact binary format that enables fast execution and is suitable for use as a compilation target for a variety of programming languages. It achieves this by offering a low-level virtual machine that runs code at near-native speed.

## Why Use WebAssembly for Desktop Applications?

There are several reasons to consider WebAssembly for building cross-platform desktop applications:

1. **Performance**: WebAssembly code is designed for efficient execution, as it runs at near-native speed. This makes it suitable for performance-critical applications.

2. **Portability**: WebAssembly applications can run on any platform that has a compatible virtual machine, making it easy to target multiple platforms without recompiling the code.

3. **Security**: WebAssembly has a strong sandboxing mechanism that ensures the safety and isolation of your application.

4. **Language Flexibility**: WebAssembly can be used as a compilation target for various languages, allowing developers to continue using their preferred programming languages.

## Getting Started with WebAssembly

To build cross-platform desktop applications using WebAssembly, you'll need a few tools and frameworks in your arsenal. The following are the primary components you'll work with:

1. **WebAssembly Compiler**: To compile your high-level language code into WebAssembly, you'll need a compatible compiler. For C and C++, you can use Emscripten, while for Rust, you can use the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

2. **WebAssembly Runtime**: To run your WebAssembly code, you'll need a runtime that provides a virtual machine. Wasmer, Wasmtime, and WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) are some popular options.

3. **Desktop Framework**: To build the user interface and interact with the system, you'll need a desktop framework. Electron, NW.js, and Tauri are excellent choices for this purpose.

### Building a Sample Application

Let's build a simple cross-platform desktop application using Rust, WebAssembly, and Tauri. We'll create a basic calculator app as an example.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- Rust and Cargo
- Node.js and npm
- Tauri CLI

#### Step 1: Create a Rust Library

Create a new Rust library:

```
$ cargo new wasm_calculator --lib
$ cd wasm_calculator
```

Edit the `src/lib.rs` file to add the following code:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a - b
}
```

Add the `wasm-bindgen` dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
```

#### Step 2: Compile the Rust Library to WebAssembly

Compile the Rust library to WebAssembly using the following command:

```
$ cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

This generates a `.wasm` file in the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` directory.

#### Step 3: Create a Tauri Application

Create a new Tauri application:

```
$ npx create-tauri-app --name wasm_calculator_app
$ cd wasm_calculator_app
```

Copy the `.wasm` file generated earlier to the `src-tauri/src` directory:

```
$ cp ../wasm_calculator/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/wasm_calculator.wasm src-tauri/src/
```

Edit the `src-tauri/src/main.rs` file to include the WebAssembly module:

```rust
fn main() {
    tauri::AppBuilder::default()
        .setup(|app| {
            // Load the WebAssembly module
            let wasm_bytes = include_bytes!("wasm_calculator.wasm");
            let wasm_module = app.load_web_assembly(wasm_bytes).unwrap();

            // Make the WebAssembly module available to the JS context
            app.window().unwrap().eval(&format!("window.wasm_calculator = {}", wasm_module)).unwrap();

            Ok(())
       })
        .build()
        .run();
}
```

#### Step 4: Create the User Interface

Edit the `src/index. file to create the user interface for the calculator:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Wasm Calculator</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app">
        <h1>Wasm Calculator</h1>
        <input type="number" id="number1" />
        <input type="number" id="number2" />
        <button id="add">Add</button>
        <button id="subtract">Subtract</button>
        <p>Result: <span id="result"></span></p>
    </div>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("add").addEventListener("click", () => {
            const number1 = parseInt(document.getElementById("number1").value);
            const number2 = parseInt(document.getElementById("number2").value);
            const result = window.wasm_calculator.add(number1, number2);
            document.getElementById("result").textContent = result;
        });

        document.getElementById("subtract").addEventListener("click", () => {
            const number1 = parseInt(document.getElementById("number1").value);
            const number2 = parseInt(document.getElementById("number2").value);
            const result = window.wasm_calculator.subtract(number1, number2);
            document.getElementById("result").textContent = result;
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Step 5: Build and Run the Application

Build and run the Tauri application:

```
$ npm run tauri:build
$ npm run tauri:serve
```

This will launch a desktop application with a calculator user interface, powered by WebAssembly.

## Conclusion

WebAssembly has opened up new possibilities for building cross-platform desktop applications. By combining it with various desktop frameworks, you can create efficient, maintainable, and secure applications that run on multiple platforms. With the ever-growing ecosystem of tools and libraries, the future of WebAssembly in desktop applications looks promising.
