## Introduction to PyTorch

PyTorch is a powerful library that offers a dynamic computation graph and GPU acceleration, making it suitable for a wide range of machine learning and deep learning tasks. PyTorch allows you to create and train complex models using an easy-to-understand Pythonic syntax.

Some key features of PyTorch are:

- **Tensor computation**: PyTorch provides a multi-dimensional array called a tensor, which can be used for various mathematical operations.
- **GPU acceleration**: PyTorch supports NVIDIA's CUDA platform, allowing tensors to be stored and operated on using GPU resources for faster computation.
- **Dynamic computation graph**: Unlike some other deep learning libraries, PyTorch allows you to create and modify computation graphs on-the-fly, providing more flexibility when developing models.
- **Autograd**: PyTorch includes a built-in automatic differentiation engine called Autograd, which simplifies the process of computing gradients for backpropagation.
- **Wide range of pre-built modules**: PyTorch provides various pre-built modules for common neural network architectures, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.

## Installation and Setup

To install PyTorch, you can use the `pip` package manager. Make sure you have Python 3 installed before proceeding.

```bash
pip install torch
```

If you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support, you can install the GPU version of PyTorch by specifying the appropriate version:

```bash
pip install torch -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu111/torch_stable.html
```

Replace `cu111` with the appropriate CUDA version number for your system.

Once installed, you can import PyTorch in your Python script:

```python
import torch
```

## Tensors

Tensors are the fundamental data structure in PyTorch and are used to represent multi-dimensional arrays. They can be created and manipulated using a NumPy-like syntax.

Here's an example of creating a tensor:

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
print(x)
```

This will output:

```
tensor([[1, 2],
        [3, 4],
        [5, 6]])
```

You can perform various operations on tensors, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more:

```python
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
y = torch.tensor([4, 5, 6])

## Element-wise addition
z = x + y
print(z)  ## Output: tensor([5, 7, 9])

## Element-wise multiplication
z = x * y
print(z)  ## Output: tensor([ 4, 10, 18])
```

## Autograd

Autograd is PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine, which computes gradients for tensor operations. To use Autograd, you must set the `requires_grad` attribute of a tensor to `True`. This will enable gradient tracking for that tensor and any operations performed on it.

Here's an example of using Autograd to compute gradients:

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x ** 2

y.backward()  ## Compute gradients

print(x.grad)  ## Output: tensor(4.0)
```

## Creating a Neural Network

To create a neural network in PyTorch, you need to define a class that inherits from `torch.nn.Module` and implement the `forward` method. This method defines the forward pass of your model.

Here's an example of creating a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class FeedforwardNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(FeedforwardNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.hidden(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.output(x)
        return x
```

## Training a Neural Network

To train a neural network, you need to define a loss function and an optimizer. PyTorch provides various loss functions and optimization algorithms in the `torch.nn` and `torch.optim` modules, respectively.

Here's an example of training the feedforward neural network defined earlier using the mean squared error loss and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

## Create synthetic data
input_data = torch.randn(100, 3)
target_data = torch.randn(100, 1)

## Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer
model = FeedforwardNN(input_size=3, hidden_size=10, output_size=1)
loss_function = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

## Train the model
for epoch in range(100):  ## Number of training epochs
    ## Forward pass
    output = model(input_data)

    ## Compute the loss
    loss = loss_function(output, target_data)

    # Backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()  ## Clear previous gradients
    loss.backward()  ## Compute gradients

    ## Update weights
    optimizer.step()

    ## Print loss for the current epoch
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```
